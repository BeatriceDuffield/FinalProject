    <section class="Why">
        <h3>Why Did We Get Into The Shark Market?</h3>
        <p>Growing up our founder, Fin McJaws was always fascinated by the ocean. He grew up near the ocean and spent a majority of his summers growing up at the beach. One day he saw a shark wash up on the beach, Fin decided to eat it. After Fin was released from the psych ward he decided that everyone should be able to see the beauty of sharks!</p>

We also have nothing to do with the large number of sharks disappearing.</p>
